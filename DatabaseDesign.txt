users = [];

//Things to get answers: 
1. Run through the log in system and look at how the database is setup.

Idea to set up our project: 
user signup and add an entry to the database.  For each user, the structure of an entry looks as follow:


Sample object inside the user array:

{
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    email: "",
    movies: [
        {
           id: (auto incremented)  
           title: "",
           imgUrl:"",
           myPick:"", (yes or no) default this yes.
           genre:"", will talk about.
           userRating:"",
           imdbRating:"",
           userReview:""
        }
    ]
}

So up top show the user's name.

Then we have the option to add a movie/tv show to the list.

Then we get the option to added it to the watchlist.

For each movie in the watchlist, user has the option to add it to the MY PICK list, and with that, the user can add userRating and userReview to such movie/TV show. (this should be done with a pop=up modal).  


So we have a watchList which displays all the movies in a table perhaps. (in a card to make it look good?)

Then on the right of the My Pick list, we have a recommended list, and this is populated by the users who has "my pick" mostly closes matched to the user's based on genre.  Then user can click on such user and browser his/her watchlist and picks.
